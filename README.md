## About Tic Tac Toe:
Tic-tac-toe is a game in which two players take turns in drawing either an ' O' or an ' X' in one square of a grid consisting of nine squares. The winner is the first player to get three squares of the same symbols in a row, column or diagonal. This C++ Code uses the MiniMax Algorithm to play as computer opponent.
